### Welcome

This document outlines my learning process from this 100 days challenge. 
I am starting off having completed one classification regression task, but was too far in the deep end to understand things with enough time. My aim is to get familiar and comfortable with using these terms and building different models.

# Day 1: Data Preprocessing

Work can be found in day_1_preprocessing.ipynb.

It includes:
1. Loading in the data
2. Handling Missing Data
3. Encoding Categorical Data
4. Splitting the Datasets into train and test
5. Feature Scaling

# Day 2: Simple Linear Regression

Work can be found in day_2_simple_linear_regression.ipynb.

It includes:
1. Preprocessing the data
2. Fitting a simple linear regression model to the training set
3. Predicting the result
4. Visualisation

# Day 3:
