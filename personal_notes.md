### Welcome

This document outlines my learning process from this 100 days challenge. 
I am starting off having completed one classification regression task, but was too far in the deep end to understand things with enough time. My aim is to get familiar and comfortable with using these terms and building different models.

# Day 1: Data Preprocessing

Work can be found in day_1_preprocessing.ipynb.

It includes:
1. Loading in the data
2. Handling Missing Data
3. Encoding Categorical Data
4. Splitting the Datasets into train and test
5. Feature Scaling

# Day 2: Simple Linear Regression

Work can be found in day_2_simple_linear_regression.ipynb. 
The aim is to predict the percentage of marks a student is supposed to get based on hours studied.

It includes:
1. Preprocessing the data
2. Fitting a simple linear regression model to the training set
3. Predicting the result
4. Visualisation

# Day 3: Multiple Linear Regression

Work can be found in day_3_multiple_linear_regression.ipynb.
The aim is to model the relationship between two or more features and a response by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The most important factor that influences the predicted outcome can also be assessed.

It includes:
1. Preprocessing the Data
2. Fitting our Model to the Training Set
3. Predicting the Test Results
